## Introduction

---

Recycling rates in Singapore are low despite various efforts to extract recyclables from waste. Contamination of recyclables is a significant problem with current methods to sort waste at source. Current recycling bins rely on human judgement to determine if a piece of trash is recyclable and uncontaminated, which has poor results.
